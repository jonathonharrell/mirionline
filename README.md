Before next minor release bump:
 - Forgot password
 - Refine layout

Before next major release bump:
 - Able to log in, create character, see some amount of UI

## @todo

#### Research
 - Captcha, email verification or other bot / spam prevention

#### Functionality (server side)
 - Add mailer (nodemailer, mail-preview, service or smtp)
 - Add forgot password [PR](https://github.com/DaftMonk/modular-fs/pull/20/files)
 - Add better session longevity [PR](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack/pull/444/files)
 - Start on character select
 - More specs (specifically for client)

#### Design (styles)
 - Color Scheme
 - Refine auth views

#### Assets (images)
 - Parralax background for auth views
 - Logo
 - Font

#### Thoughts
 - Get e2e tests back in action ? (low priority)

#### Long Term
 - Add social signup / login (Twitter / Facebook / Google+)
 - Two factor auth for local (email, SMS)
 - Add "Receive News checkbox" to settings / signup (assuming we want to send news out)
